I'm a software engineer from Amsterdam, living in North Carolina 

I have been working as a Java developer for the past decade and a half, but will happily solve problems using python, 
C, swift, go, bash or any other tool if the problem calls for it. 

My specialties are the Spring Framework, CQRS / Axon Framework and Jenkins. 

When I'm not programming, I can often be found trail running or cycling while listening to podcasts on natural 
sciences and space, or talking about dinosaurs or minecraft with my kids.
